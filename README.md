# Diabetes Prediction
 This project employs machine learning to predict diabetes, focusing on early detection to support healthcare. Using a diverse dataset, it builds a model for both men and women, analyzing health metrics like age, BMI, and HbA1c level to classify patients. The approach trains models, tests accuracy, and identifies key predictors, offering valuable clinical insights. Strengths include its broad applicability, though data biases require attention. Documentation details methods and results, with future plans for advanced algorithms and real-world deployment to enhance medical diagnostics.
